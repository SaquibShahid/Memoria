# Memoria - AI-Enhanced Chat Search Bot

## Project Overview
**Memoria** is a chatbot platform that allows users to seamlessly sync their social media accounts and search through their chat history using natural language queries. The system leverages advanced AI models to provide context-aware and efficient results, helping users find specific information (e.g., phone numbers, addresses, or conversations) without needing to recall which conversation contained the data.
